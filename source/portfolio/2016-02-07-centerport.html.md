This recently renovated craftsman style home was left situated on top of a steep but beautifully vegetated precipice. The long driveway gave no view of the front door, leading visitors directly to the garage. A 3â€™ retaining wall provides the home a visual base from the street while providing for an enlarged entry space adjacent to the front door which seems to cantilever over the hillside providing a direct connection with the natural surroundings. A Craftsman style pergola directs visitors from the driveway to the entry walk and also frames the homes only water view, which opens up in the winter. The front door is out of view and a sweeping pavement pattern pulls the visitor through the walk and away from the landing, in an effort to avoid the necessity of an abrupt 90 degree turn when approaching the homes entry. Laurels and Holly provide evergreen structure while Hydrangea and assorted perennials provide seasonal interest. A irregular stone staircase provides a secondary entrance.
