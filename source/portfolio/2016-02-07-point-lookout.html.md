These two adjacent beach properties are owned by sisters, one an existing permanent resident, the other desiring a new seasonal home. The designer’s main focus was to create an entertaining space that both residences can enjoy both visually and functionally, while maintaining a degree of aesthetic and utilitarian separation between the two residences. The axial rectangular pool is surrounded by an expanse of Limestone pavement which provides an open feel to this relatively small yard. While the majority of the yard is newly planted a windswept cluster of evergreens was maintained which create a semi-shade micro-climate, filled with cool colored flowering plantings, a perfect foil for the sundrenched backyard. The pergola and sculptural antique gate centered amidst the masonry wall and shrub border which divide the properties, strengthen the strong axial corridor emanating from the new construction. The formal rose garden, gravel pavement, Moroccan style fountain, and strong axial design of the new construction all reflect the homes distinctively Moorish feel. The connection between the interior and exterior was given the utmost consideration throughout the design phase. The linear geometry of the front façade of the home is reflected in the precast paver driveway which terminates with a vegetable garden separated into quadrants.
