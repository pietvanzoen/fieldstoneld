A collection of experiences is what best describes the new rear landscape of the sprawling Hamptons style home. Great care was given to provide a landscape that is not only visually outstanding, but creates a series of unique outdoor environments. These garden rooms work together as one project but each maintains their own character, providing the visitor with a constantly varied way to experience the garden. The dining terrace is the project's largest garden room. The room's ceiling is defined overhead by traditional style pergola, while a clipped boxwood hedge and colorful truck border suggest the space's walls. Adjacent to the terrace and accessible to a subterranean family room is the sunken garden/spa area. This hidden space is embellished by lush woodland style plantings and naturalistic stone and gravel pavements. The fire pit patio is a perfect place to spend an evening, no matter what the season. Sculptural plantings surround the circular mosaic bluestone terrace. These plantings shield the space from the surrounding landscape while there foliage seems to come alive in the flickering light from the fire. New life was given to the pool area by installing a spectacular custom granite fountain and sweeping bluestone inlay.
