This tropical oasis themed project is located in the front yard of a vintage home in a residential neighborhood. The design objective was to make a relatively small space visually and functionally larger while providing privacy from neighbors and the street, which was less than 20â€™ away. The small curved pool provides spaces at either end where swimmers cannot see each other, giving the illusion of space beyond. A stone veneered raised beam creates this separation while facilitating 3 waterfalls, whose white noise helps mask the sounds coming from the road. In the far end of the pool a private enclave was created complete with a submerged bench, candle niches built into the wall and slightly protruding stone ledges acting as drink rests. A lawn panel provides overflow seating while transitioning to a rustic stepping stone walk, laden with tropical foliage, which leads to a private irregular stone patio. A spa and outdoor shower were located on the left side of the home to take advantage of the privacy and sense of enclosure afforded by the homes facade and densely vegetated property line. The result is a visually unified yard with a series of private, intimate experiences that create a level of depth and richness, ultimately giving the illusion of a larger space.
