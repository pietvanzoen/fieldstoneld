This corner property is located next to the main entrance of the home’s new development. The client sought to create a summer oriented entertaining space while giving the utmost importance to achieving complete privacy from the nearby entrance. The property’s slope was used to separate the yard into two definitive spaces and became the first element in an effort to achieve total privacy from the road. The upper lawn area provides an area for play and visually terminates with a sculpture which reflects the home’s interior and client’s contemporary tastes. The pool lounge area is partially surrounded by a stone retaining wall which facilitates three waterfalls that mask noise from the roadway. A dense summer flowering shrub border above the wall and evergreen screen at the property line complete the visual separation. Crepe Myrtles form a canopy over the lounge area creating a sense of enclosure and intimacy while providing a foreground for views to and from the upper lawn area. The limestone clad patio is almost completely enclosed by lush vegetation with a heavy emphasis on summer color. A ‘borrowed’ view is captured into the developments pond area which gives the illusion that this relatively modest space is part of a much larger environment.
