<blockquote>
	<p>&ldquo;I think of Fieldstone as a "boutique" company in that we focus on high quality design, impeccable craftsmanship and highly personalized service. I personally enjoy taking a direct orchestrating role in all phases of the project from concept to construction. It is this intimate involvement with the project and the client that enables our vision to be realized as intended. Just as importantly, this personalized service also creates a strong lasting bond with clients who continue to serve as the core of my business through recommendations and referrals. I hope you enjoy looking through the portfolio. It is a small selection of my work throughout my career.&rdquo;</p>
